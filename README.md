# Member Quiz

Member Quiz offers a template for a photo-name matching trivia app. A randomized photo is displayed, and four names, one real and 3 random, are displayed as options. I implemented the app using photos and names of friends, but the code is easily refactored to use any set of photos.

Features include: randomized answers for each question, multiple choice selection, score tracking, answer history, and animated button presses.
